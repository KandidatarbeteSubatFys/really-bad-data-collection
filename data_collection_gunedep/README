These files lets you create txt-files using the gunedepXB/DALI-variables.
If any of the particles deposits less than 90% (this value can be changed) of its energy in the detector the event
is thrown away.
Standing in the directory of your root-file, do: 
./gen_data_gunedep_<NAME OF DETECTOR>.sh <NAME OF ROOT-FILE>.root
and the required txt-files should be generated.
The simulation has to be made with options: 
--det=tree-gun-edep and --tree=gunlist,<NAME OF ROOT-FILE>.root
To create data with varying nummber of guns do --gun=...,prob=w for each gun where w=[0,1] is probability for that gun
to fire. This will cause variable gunn to vary for each event.

The h102.C- and h102.h-files are deleted after process is finished.

Currently this only works for XB
ToDo: 
-implement DALI
-include info on phi angle
