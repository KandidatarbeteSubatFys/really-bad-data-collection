Sh-scripts for doing some basic stuff at Kebnekaise. Filenames are somewhat self-explanatory. Run by typing . <scriptname>.sh.

salloc_node.sh takes arguments:

#1: proj nr e.g. 2017-1-611
#2: real allocating time (minutes)
#3: nr of GPUs
#4: nr of tasks
#5: if you want whole node type --exclusive

srun_job.sh uses aquired jobid after allocating a node/nodes.
