Program for determining the multiplicity of gamma particles in the crystal ball detector.

IMPORTANT: Thus far the data has to be ordered from the lowest amount of guns to the highest amount of guns. So the events with number of
guns=1 should come first in the gun file, then all the events with number of guns=2 and so on. Shouldn't be to hard to fix so that this wouldn't be neccesary, but it's simple to make the textfile in the correct order with the gamma_auto_home.py program.

Also important is that there should be approximately the same number of event for each number of guns.
