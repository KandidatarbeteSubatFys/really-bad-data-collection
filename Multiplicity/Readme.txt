Program for determining the multiplicity of gamma particles in the crystal ball detector.

IMPORTANT: Thus far the data has to be ordered from the lowest amount of guns to the highest amount of guns. So the events with number of
guns=1 should come first in the gun file, then all the events with number of guns=2 and so on. Shouldn't be to hard to fix this so would
be nice if somebody did that.

Also important is that there should be the same number of event for different number of guns.
