Program for determining the multiplicity of gamma particles in the crystal ball detector.

IMPORTANT: Thus far the data has to ordered from the lowest amount of guns to the highest amount of guns. So the events with number of
guns=1 should come first in the gun file, then all the events with number of guns=2 and so on. Shouldn't be to hard to fix this so would
be nice if somebody did that.
